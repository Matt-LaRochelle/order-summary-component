## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts
- Checking colors, sizes, and spacing

### What I learned

I am trying to build things that are dynamic and simple. I am abandoning the idea of being pixel perfect and instead going for the "spirit" of the design. While I want things to be as close as possible to the original, it needs to be shaped dynamically. On another note, I am working on different text colors for various sections and find it surprising how much the different colors make the website feel more interesting without bringing attention to itself. It's a subtle thing.


### Continued development

I continue to strive for readability and simplicity in my CSS and I also want to continue to work on understanding color palates and the wide array of options I have for spicing up the website in subtle but meaningful ways.
